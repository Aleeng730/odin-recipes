        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Combine Sugar, Coffee and Water</h3>
            <p>In a medium bowl, combine sugar, coffee, and water. Using a hand mixer or a whisk, vigorously whisk until mixture turns silky smooth and shiny, then continue whisking until it thickens and holds its lofty, foamy shape. (If whisking by hand, it will take 8 to 12 minutes to get to optimal fluffiness.)
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
            <p>Fill a glass most of the way full with ice and milk, then dollop and swirl the whipped coffee mixture on top, mixing before drinking, if desired.</p>
